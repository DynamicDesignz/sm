BDSM's target audience is people stuck setting up their own servers not on a cloud extension.
Essentially I am building it to be a 'core' such that people can create 'plugins' for it which are called "extensions"
There are only a few requirements for the 'extensions' like that it's a directory with executable files in it and with a few rules on what should be available (like $extension/help)
This means that the contents can be C compiled binaries, Ruby Scripts, python, lua, whatever
of course the extensions *I* write will likely be in bash ;)

I am creating it with completely pluggable architecture so that people can write their own as I do not want to support everything myself So I will make the core and encourage extension building


that's up to the extension builder
each $extension/ dir has a templates/ dir that the extension will use for it's own purposes
I'm debating on releasing it in the next two weeks
mutle: so do you think it would be useful for people?
